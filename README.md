Hello this script was made to make an assignment I have for Uni quicker.
Sod doing the same thing for like 7 sets of data all by hand, instead do what most of us do and take longer automating it :D

I might make some changes at some point to the script as it is really basic and not all that pretty, but it get's the job done.

What I'd like to do if it's possible:

~~1) Add an option to work to desired significant figure.~~
   Significant figures are apparently very computationally tricky. Decimal Point rounding it is :)
   
~~2) Add the ability for the script to compare the chi-squared value against a chi-sqaured table and report on significance
   (Also allow for the choice of degrees freedom)~~
   Now performs chi-squared analysis against a 0.05 significance value with a Degrees of Freedom value of 1
   _DOF must be changed within the script accordingly if needed. May attempt to allow for custom DOF input in the future._


If I can think of anything else that'd also make it better then yay, if not enjoy lol :)


Oh and it requires Python if you don't have it (You're on a python script repo go get Python..)
