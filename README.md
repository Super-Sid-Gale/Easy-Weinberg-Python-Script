Hello this script was made to make an assignment I have for Uni quicker.
Fuck doing the same thing for 7 sets of data all by hand, instead do what most of us do and take longer automating it :D

I might make some changes at some point to the script as it is really basic, but it get's the job done.

What I'd like to do if it's possible:

1) Add an option to work to desired significant figure.
2) Add the ability for the script to compare the chi-squared value against a chi-sqaured table and report on significance
   (Also allow for the choice of degrees freedom)


If I can think of anything else that'd also make it better then yay, if not enjoy lol :)
